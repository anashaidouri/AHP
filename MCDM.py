st.markdown(" ##### Future of MCDM")
st.write("Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) technology is already transforming the way complex decisions are made. In the future, MCDM is likely to become even more powerful and influential due to the increasing availability of big data, advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and improvements in computer hardware and software. These factors will allow for more sophisticated decision-making tools that can adapt and learn over time, making real-time decision making possible in complex environments.")
st.write("One of the most promising areas for the application of MCDM technology is in the field of sustainability. As the world faces growing concerns about climate change and environmental degradation, MCDM techniques can be used to help organizations and governments make decisions that balance economic, social, and environmental factors. By using MCDM to analyze large amounts of data and identify the most sustainable options, decision makers can ensure that their decisions are not only financially sound, but also environmentally responsible and socially equitable. The future of MCDM technology is bright, and its potential to transform decision-making processes will likely have far-reaching implications for a wide range of industries and sectors.")
